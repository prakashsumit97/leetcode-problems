● Implemented appropriate indexing strategies on MongoDB collections to
 nhance query performance, significantly reducing read times for frequently accessed data.
● Conducted an analysis to identify data that required long-term storage
versus transient data that could be discarded after a certain period.
  Implemented a TTL (Time-to-Live) index in MongoDB for transient data,
●
setting it to automatically delete documents over a period of time.
